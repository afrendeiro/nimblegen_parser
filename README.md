NimbleGen tiling array file parser
================
This software is intended to be primarily a parser for NimbleGen tiling array files from microarray experiments. Latter sample quality control, normalization, statistics and enrichment analysis are though to be implemented.

All these features are already available in a lot of packages in other languages (e.g. R) but the goal is to make this an all-Python software that runs smoothly with low memory consumption, yet in a personalized way if so intended.
